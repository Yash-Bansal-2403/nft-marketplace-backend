# NFT Marketplace Backend

# Getting Started

## Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    -   You can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You can run:
        -   `node --version` and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`

## Quickstart

```
git clone  https://github.com/Yash-Bansal-2403/nft-marketplace-backend.git
npm install
```

# Usage

Deploy:

```
npm hardhat deploy
```

## Testing

```
npx hardhat test
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You have to set your environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

-   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
-   `GOERLI_RPC_URL`: This is url of the goerli testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH & LINK. You should see the ETH and LINK show up in your metamask.

3. Setup a Chainlink VRF Subscription ID

Head over to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and setup a new subscription, and get a subscriptionId. You can reuse an old subscription if you already have one.

[You can follow the instructions](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/) if you get lost. You should leave this step with:

-   Subscription ID
-   Your subscription should be funded with LINK

4. Deploy

In your `helper-hardhat-config.js` add your `subscriptionId` under the section of the chainId you're using (aka, if you're deploying to goerli, add your `subscriptionId` in the `subscriptionId` field under the `5` section.)

Then run:

```
npx hardhat deploy --network goerli
```

And copy / remember the contract address.

5. Add your contract address as a Chainlink VRF Consumer

Go back to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link) and under your subscription add `Add consumer` and add your contract address. You should also fund the contract with a minimum of 1 LINK.

6. Register a Chainlink Keepers Upkeep

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/compatible-contracts/)

Go to [keepers.chain.link](https://keepers.chain.link/new) and register a new upkeep. Choose `Custom logic` as your trigger mechanism for automation. Your UI will look something like this once completed:

![Keepers](./img/keepers.png)

7. Enter your lottery!

You're contract is now setup to be a tamper proof autonomous verifiably random lottery. Enter the lottery by running:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/enter.js --network goerli
```

## Verify on etherscan

If you deploy to a testnet or mainnet, you can verify it if you get an [API Key](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) from Etherscan and set it as an environemnt variable named `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`. You can pop it into your `.env` file as seen in the `.env.example`.

In it's current state, if you have your api key set, it will auto verify goerli contracts!

However, you can manual verify with:

```
npx hardhat verify --constructor-args arguments.js DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

# Thank you!
